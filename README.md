# ChromTech Next Generation LabVIEW Drivers

These drivers can be used to help LabVIEW software communicate with a 
ChromTech Next Generation pump.

## Installation

For install using VIPM download the latest `.vip` from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/RxnRover/driver_chromtech_next_gen/releases)

Download the library by clicking the "Code" button and selecting "Download 
ZIP". Extract the ZIP file into your `<labview>/instr.lib/` directory, where 
`<labview>` is the location of your LabVIEW installation. `instr.lib` is where 
instrument drivers are placed so they can be found by other LabVIEW projects.
